# Security Policy
If you've found a serious security flaw in Vyxal, **do not open a public issue**. Instead, open a security advisory [here](https://github.com/Vyxal/Vyxal/security/advisories). We will discuss privately how to handle it, hopefully
apply a fix, and you will be honoured in the **Hall of Fame**.
